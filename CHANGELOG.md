### BREAKING CHANGES

* Stop supporting receiving the wallet format as type of the wallet type.
  For example, `wallet:bitcoin-bip44` is not supported anymore.
  The CORRECT way to pass in the wallet format is inside the keys object which is in the walletInfo.
  Example:

  ```js
  walletInfo = {
    keys: {
      seed: 'whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever',
      format: 'bip49'
    }
  }
  ```

* Split each currency Info into 3 different config objects depends on the where and how they are going to be used:
  1. bcoinInfo - The data needed to extend Bcoin into supporting the currency
  2. engineInfo - The hard coded data needed to configure the engine for the currency
  3. currencyInfo - The original EdgeCurrencyInfo needed to be passed on to core/gui according to the API specs - This got ALOT cleaner

  Also typed everything so no more using `defaultSettings` which was typed as Any as a garbage hole where we stuffed everything we didn't know where to put.
  Everything is now strongly typed so keep it like that.

### New Features

* `getSplittableTypes` API to the plugin.
* bip84 wallet type as default to the networks that supports it.
* Settings and factories for `BitcoinGold` and `BitcoinGoldTestnet`.

### Fix

* Two Way Replay Protection scheme.
* `sweepPrivateKey` only signed with a key corresponding to the wallet type. Now we try all possible combinations.

## 2.22.0

* Full support for bip84 wallets.
* Removed all of the $FlowFixMe (except for the one for 'buffer-hack') from the code.
